KNN, acronym for K Nearest Neighbors, is a supervised learning algorithm. It is used for classification as well as regression problems.

Pseudocode for KNN:
1. Load the dataset
2. Take the new data to be classified
3. Find distances between that data point and all the other data points in the dataset
4. Sort the distances
5. Select top k labels and find the label with maximum frequency
6. Label the new data as the class with maximum frequency

Implementation is provided.
